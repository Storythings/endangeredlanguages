# Endangered Languages
A pseudo-Dorling cartogram of the worlds threatened, disappearing or extinct languages. See it working [here](https://duncangeere.github.io/endangeredlanguages/).

Built with [D3v3](https://d3js.org/), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson) and [d3-tip](http://labratrevenge.com/d3-tip/).

Language data from Unesco via the [Guardian Datablog](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/15/language-extinct-endangered). World map from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). Code adapted from [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4055892).

To do:
* Allow pan and zoom
* Dynamically resize when browser window is resized
* Add a legend
* Style the page properly
* Better colours
* Less violent initial burst of motion
* More info in the tooltips (probably just speaker count)
* Tooltips don't go off the top of the map
* Update to D3v4?
